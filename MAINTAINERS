		    List of upstream flashrom maintainers

This represents the list of maintainers that work on the upstream flashrom
code base (on flashrom.org).  Maintainers are assigned to topics and when
applicable to subtrees of the source tree. You'll find some subtrees that
don't have a maintainer. If you are looking for reviewers for such a subtree,
it's often a good choice to look at the git history to see who worked on
it last.

Please try to follow our [development guidelines]. This will make things
easier on the maintainers. Not all of these guidelines matter for every
trivial patch. So apply some common sense.

Happy hacking!

Descriptions of section entries:

	M: Maintainer: FullName <address@domain>
	   Must be registered to Gerrit (https://review.coreboot.org) and
	   must have experience with upstream flashrom development.
	R: Designated reviewer: FullName <address@domain>
	   These reviewers are CCed on patches.
	L: Mailing list that is relevant to this area
	W: Web-page with status/info
	S: Status, one of the following:
	   Supported:	Someone is continuously paid to look after this and
			a reaction to review requests can be expected
			within a few days, a month at most.
	   Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it and a reaction to
			review requests can usually be expected within a
			few weeks.
	   Odd Fixes:	It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
			much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..
	   Orphan:	No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
			role as you write your new code].
	   Obsolete:	Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
			it has been replaced by a better system and you
			should be using that.
	F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	drivers/net/	all files in and below drivers/net
	   F:	drivers/net/*	all files in drivers/net, but not below
	   F:	*/net/*		all files in "any top level directory"/net
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
	N: Files and directories with regex patterns.
	   N:	[^a-z]tegra	all files whose path contains the word tegra
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple N: lines acceptable.
	   scripts/get_maintainer.pl has different behavior for files that
	   match F: pattern and matches of N: patterns.  By default,
	   get_maintainer will not look at git log history when an F: pattern
	   match occurs.  When an N: match occurs, git log history is used
	   to also notify the people that have git commit signatures.
	X: Files and directories that are NOT maintained, same rules as F:
	   Files exclusions are tested before file matches.
	   Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance:
	   F:	net/
	   X:	net/ipv6/
	   matches all files in and below net excluding net/ipv6/
	K: Keyword perl extended regex pattern to match content in a
	   patch or file.  For instance:
	   K: of_get_profile
	      matches patches or files that contain "of_get_profile"
	   K: \b(printk|pr_(info|err))\b
	      matches patches or files that contain one or more of the words
	      printk, pr_info or pr_err
	   One regex pattern per line.  Multiple K: lines acceptable.

Note: The categories and topics in this list are meant to remain in alphabetical
      order. Please keep them sorted when you change them.
