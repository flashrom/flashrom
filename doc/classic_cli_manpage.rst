DESCRIPTION
-----------

**flashrom** is a utility for detecting, reading, writing, verifying and erasing flash chips.
It's often used to flash BIOS/EFI/coreboot/firmware images in-system using a supported mainboard.
However, it also supports various external PCI/USB/parallel-port/serial-port based devices which can program flash
chips, including some network cards (NICs), SATA/IDE controller cards, graphics cards, the Bus Pirate device,
various FTDI FT2232/FT4232H/FT4233H/FT232H based USB devices, and more.

It supports a wide range of DIP32, PLCC32, DIP8, SO8/SOIC8, TSOP32, TSOP40, TSOP48, and BGA chips,
which use various protocols such as LPC, FWH, parallel flash, or SPI.


OPTIONS
-------

You can specify one of ``-h``, ``-R``, ``-L``, ``-E``, ``-r``, ``-w``, ``-v``, a RPMC command or no operation.
If no operation is specified, **flashrom** will only probe for flash chips. It is recommended that if you try **flashrom** the
first time on a system, you run it in probe-only mode and check the output.
Also you are advised to make a backup of your current ROM contents with ``-r`` before you try to write a new image.
All operations involving any chip access (probe/read/write/...) require the ``-p/--programmer`` option to be used (please see below).


**-r, --read [<file>]**
        Read flash ROM contents and save them into the given **<file>**.
        If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.

        The **<file>** parameter is required here unless reading is restricted to one or more flash regions via the ``-i/--include`` parameter
        and the file is specified there. See the ``--include`` section below for examples.


**-w, --write (<file>|-)**
        Write **<file>** into flash ROM. If **-** is provided instead, contents will be read from stdin.
        This will first automatically erase the chip, then write to it.

        In the process the chip is also read several times. First an in-memory backup is made for disaster recovery and to be
        able to skip regions that are already equal to the image file.
        This copy is updated along with the write operation. In case of erase errors it is even re-read completely.
        After writing has finished and if verification is enabled, the whole flash chip is read out and compared with the input image.

        The **<file>** parameter is required here unless writing is restricted to one or more flash regions via the ``-i/--include`` parameter
        and the file is specified there. See the ``--include`` section below for examples.


**-n, --noverify**
        Skip the automatic verification of flash ROM contents after writing. Using this option is **not** recommended,
        you should only use it if you know what you are doing and if you feel that the time for verification takes too long.

        Typical usage is::

                flashrom -p prog -n -w <file>

        This option is only useful in combination with ``--write``.


**-N, --noverify-all**
        Skip not included regions during automatic verification after writing (cf. ``-l`` and ``-i``).
        You should only use this option if you are sure that communication with the flash chip is reliable
        (e.g. when using the **internal** programmer).
        Even if **flashrom** is instructed not to touch parts of the flash chip, their contents could be damaged
        (e.g. due to misunderstood erase commands).

        This option is required to flash an Intel system with locked ME flash region using the **internal** programmer.
        It may be enabled by default in this case in the future.


**-v, --verify (<file>|-)**
        Verify the flash ROM contents against the given **<file>**.
        If **-** is provided instead, contents will be written to the stdout.

        The **<file>** parameter is required here unless verification is restricted to one or more flash regions via the ``-i/--include`` parameter
        and the file is specified there. See the ``--include`` section below for examples.


**-E, --erase**
        Erase the flash ROM chip.


**-x, --extract**
        Extract every region defined on the layout from flash ROM chip to a file with the same name as the extracted region
        (replacing spaces with underscores).


**-V, --verbose**
        More verbose output. This option can be supplied multiple times (max. 3 times, i.e. ``-VVV`` ) for even more debug output.


**-c, --chip <chipname>**
        Probe only for the specified flash ROM chip. This option takes the chip name as printed by ``flashrom -L`` without the
        vendor name as parameter. Please note that the chip name is case sensitive.


**-f, --force**
        Force one or more of the following actions:

        * Force chip read and pretend the chip is there.
        * Force chip access even if the chip is bigger than the maximum supported size for the flash bus.
        * Force erase even if erase is known bad.
        * Force write even if write is known bad.


**-l, --layout <file>**
        Read ROM layout from **<file>**.

        **flashrom** supports ROM layouts. This allows you to flash certain parts of the flash chip only.
        A ROM layout file contains multiple lines with the following syntax::

                startaddr:endaddr imagename

        ``startaddr`` and ``endaddr`` are hexadecimal addresses within the ROM file and do not refer to any physical address.
        Please note that using a 0x prefix for those hexadecimal numbers is not necessary, but you can't specify decimal/octal numbers.
        ``imagename`` is an arbitrary name for the region/image from ``startaddr`` to ``endaddr`` (both addresses included).

        Example::

                00000000:00008fff gfxrom
                00009000:0003ffff normal
                00040000:0007ffff fallback

        If you only want to update the image named **normal** in a ROM based on the layout above, run::

                flashrom -p prog --layout rom.layout --image normal -w some.rom

        To update only the images named **normal** and **fallback**, run::

                flashrom -p prog -l rom.layout -i normal -i fallback -w some.rom

        Overlapping sections are not supported.


**--fmap**
        Read layout from fmap in flash chip.

        **flashrom** supports the fmap binary format which is commonly used by coreboot for partitioning a flash chip.
        The on-chip fmap will be read and used to generate the layout.

        If you only want to update the **COREBOOT** region defined in the fmap, run::

                flashrom -p prog --fmap --image COREBOOT -w some.rom


**--fmap-file <file>**
        Read layout from a **<file>** containing binary fmap (e.g. coreboot roms).

        **flashrom** supports the fmap binary format which is commonly used by coreboot for partitioning a flash chip.
        The fmap in the specified file will be read and used to generate the layout.

        If you only want to update the **COREBOOT** region defined in the binary fmap file, run::

                flashrom -p prog --fmap-file some.rom --image COREBOOT -w some.rom


**--ifd**
        Read ROM layout from Intel Firmware Descriptor.

        **flashrom** supports ROM layouts given by an Intel Firmware Descriptor (IFD).
        The on-chip descriptor will be read and used to generate the layout. If you need to change the layout,
        you have to update the IFD only first.

        The following ROM images may be present in an IFD:

                | ``fd``    - the IFD itself
                | ``bios``  - the host firmware aka. BIOS
                | ``me``    - Intel Management Engine firmware
                | ``gbe``   - gigabit ethernet firmware
                | ``pd``    - platform specific data


**-i, --include <region>[:<file>]**
        Read, write, or verify only **<region>** to or from ROM.
        The **-i** option may be used multiple times if the user wishes to read, write, or verify multiple regions using a single command.

        The user may optionally specify a corresponding **<file>** for any region they wish to read or write.
        A read operation will read the corresponding regions from ROM and write individual files for each one.
        A write option will read file(s) and write to the corresponding region(s) in ROM.

        For all read/write/verify operations, the **<file>** parameter following those operations becomes optional and will be ignored
        if present whenever the <file> is specified following the region.

        Common rules for -r/-w/-v syntax parsing:

         - If no filename is specified at all, quit.

         - If a file is specified for -r/-w/-v and no files are specified with
           -i args (or -i is not used), then that file will be used for reading/
           writing/verifying the entire ROM.

         - If no filename is specified for -r/-w/-v, but files are specified
           for -i, then the number of file arguments for -i options must be
           equal to the total number of -i options.

        Rules for reading:

         - If files are specified for -i args but not -r, do partial reads for
           each -i arg, creating a new file for each region. Each -i option
           must specify a filename.

         - If filenames are specified for -r and -i args, then:

             - Do partial read for each -i arg, creating a new file for
               each region where a filename is provided (-i region:filename).
             - Create a ROM-sized file with partially filled content. For each
               -i arg, fill the corresponding offset with content from ROM.

        Rules for writing and verifying:

         - If files are specified for both -w/-v and -i args, -i files take
           priority (files specified for -w/-v are unused).

         - If files are specified for -i args but not -w, do partial writes
           for each -i arg. Likewise for -v and -i args. All -i args must
           supply a filename. Any omission is considered ambiguous.

         - Regions with a filename associated must not overlap. This is also
           considered ambiguous. Note: This is checked later since it requires
           processing the layout/fmap first.

        Examples:
                To read regions named **foo** and **bar** in layout file **<layout>** into region-sized files **foo.bin** and **bar.bin**, run::

                        flashrom -p prog -r -l <layout> -i foo:foo.bin -i bar:bar.bin

                To write files **foo.bin** and **bar.bin** into regions named **foo** and **bar** in layout file **<layout>** to the ROM, run::

                        flashrom -p prog -w -l <layout> -i foo:foo.bin -i bar:bar.bin

                To verify regions named **foo** and **bar** using layout file **<layout>** and files **foo.bin** and **bar.bin**, run::

                        flashrom -p prog -v -l <layout> -i foo:foo.bin -i bar:bar.bin


**--wp-status**
        Prints the flash's current status register protection mode and write protection range.


**--wp-list**
        Prints a list of all protection ranges that the flash supports.


**--wp-enable**
        Enables hardware status register protection (SRP) if the flash supports it.
        Once SRP is enabled, operations that change the flash's status registers (including ``--wp-disable`` and ``--wp-range``)
        can only be performed if the flash's #WP pin is at an inactive logic level.


**--wp-disable**
        Disables status register protection if the flash allows it.


**--wp-range <start>,<length>**
        Configures the flash to protect a range of addresses from <start> to (<start> + <length> - 1), bounds inclusive.
        The range must be supported by the flash, see ``--wp-list``.


**--wp-region <region>**
        Same as ``--wp-range`` but protects the range occupied by an image region.
        This option requires a image layout to be specified, see ``--layout``.
        The region must be supported by the flash, see ``--wp-list``.


**--flash-name**
        Prints out the detected flash chip's name.


**--flash-size**
        Prints out the detected flash chip's size.


**--flash-contents <ref-file>**
        The file contents of **<ref-file>** will be used to decide which parts of the flash need to be written.
        Providing this saves an initial read of the full flash chip.
        Be careful, if the provided data doesn't actually match the flash contents, results are undefined.


**-L, --list-supported**
        List the flash chips, chipsets, mainboards, and external programmers (including PCI, USB, parallel port, and serial port based devices)
        supported by **flashrom**.

        There are many unlisted boards which will work out of the box, without special support in **flashrom**.
        Please let us know if you can verify that other boards work or do not work out of the box.

        **IMPORTANT**:
        For verification you have to test an ERASE and/or WRITE operation, so make sure you only do that if you have proper means to recover from failure!

        Some programmers have optional or mandatory parameters which are described in detail in the
        **PROGRAMMER-SPECIFIC INFORMATION** section. Support for some programmers can be disabled at compile time.
        ``flashrom -h`` lists all supported programmers.


**-h, --help**
        Show a help text and exit.


**-o, --output <logfile>**
        Save the full debug log to **<logfile>**.
        If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. This is the recommended way to gather logs from **flashrom**
        because they will be verbose even if the on-screen messages are not verbose and don't require output redirection.


**--progress**
        Show progress percentage of operations on the standard output.

**--sacrifice-ratio <ratio>**
        Fraction (as a percentage, 0-50) of an erase block that may be erased even if unmodified.
        Larger values may complete programming faster, but may also hurt chip longevity by erasing cells unnecessarily.

        Default is 0, S+1 size block only selected if all the S size blocks inside it need to be erased in full.
        50 means that if more than a half of the area needs to be erased,
        a S+1 size block can be selected to cover all the area with one erase.
        The tradeoff is the speed of programming operation VS the longevity of the chip. Default is longevity.

        DANGEROUS! It wears your chip faster!


**-R, --version**
        Show version information and exit.

RPMC commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes the commands added in JESD260. They are only supported on specific chip models.
If the chip is detected correctly but you still get ``Error: RPMC commands are not supported on this device``,
try using ``-c "SFDP-capable chip"`` for automatic feature detection.

**--get-rpmc-status**
        Read the extended RPMC status by issuing a OP2 command

        Example::

                flashrom -p prog --get-rpmc-status


**--write-root-key**
        Write new root key from **--rpmc-root-key**  file for **--counter-address**.

        Example::

                flashrom -p prog --rpmc-root-key <keyfile> --counter-address <address> --write-root-key

**--update-hmac-key**
        Update the hmac key register for **--counter-address** with the provided **--key-data**.
        Requires valid **--rpmc-root-key**.

        Example::

                flashrom -p prog --rpmc-root-key <keyfile> --counter-address <address> --key-data <value> --update-hmac-key

**--increment-counter <current>**
        Increments the counter at **--counter-address** by one above the **<current>**.
        Requires previously updated **--key-data** and valid **--rpmc-root-key**.

        Examples::

                flashrom -p prog --rpmc-root-key <keyfile> --counter-address <address> --key-data <value> --increment-counter 12
                flashrom -p prog --rpmc-root-key <keyfile> --counter-address <address> --key-data <value> -w rom.bin --update-hmac-key --increment-counter 25

**--get-counter**
        Get the current counter value for **--counter-address**.
        Requires previously updated **--key-data** and valid **--rpmc-root-key**.

        Examples::

                flashrom -p prog --rpmc-root-key <keyfile> --counter-address <address> --key-data <value> --get-counter
                flashrom -p prog --rpmc-root-key <keyfile> --counter-address <address> --key-data <value> --update-hmac-key --get-counter

RPMC options
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**--counter-address <address>**
        Target the counter at **<address>** for any RPMC operations.
        Addressing starts at 0.
        Defaults to 0.

        Example::

                flashrom --counter-address 2

**--rpmc-root-key <keyfile>**
        Use **<keyfile>** as location of 32-byte root key.

        Example::

                flashrom --rpmc-root-key /home/user/some_key.bin

**--key-data <value>**
        Hexadecimal **<value>** will be used as 4-byte key data in RPMC operations.
        Defaults to 0.

        Example::

                flashrom --key-data 12abc

PROGRAMMER-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
-------------------------------
Some programmer drivers accept further parameters to set programmer-specific parameters. These parameters are separated
from the programmer name by a colon. While some programmers take arguments atfixed positions, other programmers use a
key/value interface in which the key and value is separated by an equal sign and different pairs are separated by a
comma or a colon.


internal programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


**Board Enables**
        Some mainboards require to run mainboard specific code to enable flash erase and write support
        (and probe support on old systems with parallel flash).
        The mainboard brand and model (if it requires specific code) is usually autodetected using one of the following mechanisms:
        If your system is running coreboot, the mainboard type is determined from the coreboot table.
        Otherwise, the mainboard is detected by examining the onboard PCI devices and possibly DMI info.
        If PCI and DMI do not contain information to uniquely identify the mainboard (which is the exception),
        or if you want to override the detected mainboard model, you can specify the mainboard using the::

                flashrom -p internal:mainboard=<vendor>:<board>

        syntax.

        See the **Known boards** or **Known laptops** section in the output of ``flashrom -L`` for a list of boards
        which require the specification of the board name, if no coreboot table is found.

        Some of these board-specific flash enabling functions (called **board enables** ) in **flashrom** have not yet been tested.
        If your mainboard is detected needing an untested board enable function, a warning message is printed and the board enableis not executed,
        because a wrong board enable function might cause the system to behave erratically, as board enable functions touch the
        low-level internals of a mainboard.
        Not executing a board enable function (if one is needed) might cause detection or erasing failure.
        If your board protects only part of the flash (commonly the top end, called boot block),
        **flashrom** might encounter an error only after erasing the unprotected part, so running without the board-enable function
        might be dangerous for erase and write (which includes erase).

        The suggested procedure for a mainboard with untested board specific code is to first try to probe the ROM
        (just invoke **flashrom** and check that it detects your flash chip type) without running the board enable code
        (i.e. without any parameters). If it finds your chip, fine. Otherwise, retry probing your chip with the board-enable code running, using::

                flashrom -p internal:boardenable=force

        If your chip is still not detected, the board enable code seems to be broken or the flash chip unsupported.
        Otherwise, make a backup of your current ROM contents (using ``-r``) and store it to a medium outside of your computer,
        like a USB drive or a network share. If you needed to run the board enable code already for probing, use it for reading too.
        If reading succeeds and the contents of the read file look legit you can try to write the new image.
        You should enable the board enable code in any case now, as it has been written because it is known that writing/erasing
        without the board enable is going to fail. In any case (success or failure), please report to the **flashrom** mailing list, see below.

**Coreboot**
        On systems running coreboot, **flashrom** checks whether the desired image matches your mainboard.
        This needs some special board ID to be present in the image.
        If **flashrom** detects that the image you want to write and the current board do not match,
        it will refuse to write the image unless you specify::

                flashrom -p internal:boardmismatch=force


**ITE IT87 Super I/O**
        If your mainboard is manufactured by GIGABYTE and supports DualBIOS it is very likely that it uses an
        ITE IT87 series Super I/O to switch between the two flash chips.
        Only one of them can be accessed at a time and you can manually select which one to use with the::

                flashrom -p internal:dualbiosindex=chip

        syntax where ``chip`` is the index of the chip to use (0 = main, 1 = backup).
        You can check which one is currently selected by leaving out the ``chip`` parameter.

        If your mainboard uses an ITE IT87 series Super I/O for LPC<->SPI flash bus translation, **flashrom** should autodetect that configuration.
        If you want to set the I/O base port of the IT87 series SPI controller manually instead of using the value provided by the BIOS,
        use the::

                flashrom -p internal:it87spiport=portnum

        syntax where ``portnum`` is the I/O port number (must be a multiple of 8).
        In the unlikely case **flashrom** doesn't detect an active IT87 LPC<->SPI bridge, please send a bug report so we can diagnose the problem.


**AMD chipsets**
        Beginning with the SB700 chipset there is an integrated microcontroller (IMC) based on the 8051 embedded in every AMD southbridge.
        Its firmware resides in the same flash chip as the host's which makes writing to the flash risky if the IMC is active.
        Flashrom tries to temporarily disable the IMC but even then changing the contents of the flash can have unwanted effects:
        when the IMC continues (at the latest after a reboot) it will continue executing code from the flash.
        If the code was removed or changed in an unfortunate way it is unpredictable what the IMC will do.
        Therefore, if **flashrom** detects an active IMC it will disable write support unless the user forces it with the::

                flashrom -p internal:amd_imc_force=yes

        syntax. The user is responsible for supplying a suitable image or leaving out the IMC region with the help of a layout file.
        This limitation might be removed in the future when we understand the details better and have received enough feedback from users.
        Please report the outcome if you had to use this option to write a chip.

        An optional ``spispeed`` parameter specifies the frequency of the SPI bus where applicable
        (i.e.SB600 or later with an SPI flash chip directly attached to the chipset).
        Syntax is::

                flashrom -p internal:spispeed=frequency

        where ``frequency`` can be ``'16.5 MHz'``, ``'22 MHz'``, ``'33 MHz'``, ``'66 MHz'``, ``'100 MHZ'``, or ``'800 kHz'``.
        Support of individual frequencies depends on the generation of the chipset:

        * SB6xx, SB7xx, SP5xxx: from 16.5 MHz up to and including 33 MHz.
          The default is to use 16.5 MHz and disable Fast Reads.
        * SB8xx, SB9xx, Hudson: from 16.5 MHz up to and including 66 MHz.
          The default is to use 16.5 MHz and disable Fast Reads.
        * Yangtze (with SPI 100 engine as found in Kabini and Tamesh): all of them.
          The default is to use the frequency that is currently configured.

        An optional ``spireadmode`` parameter specifies the read mode of the SPI bus where applicable (Bolton or later).
        Syntax is::

                flashrom -p internal:spireadmode=mode

        where ``mode`` can be ``'Normal (up to 33 MHz)'``, ``'Normal (up to 66 MHz)'``, ``'Dual IO (1-1-2)'``, ``'Quad IO (1-1-4)'``,
        ``'Dual IO (1-2-2)'``, ``'Quad IO (1-4-4)'``, or ``'Fast Read'``.

        The default is to use the read mode that is currently configured.


**Intel chipsets**
        If you have an Intel chipset with an ICH8 or later southbridge with SPI flash attached, and if a valid descriptor was written
        to it (e.g. by the vendor), the chipset provides an alternative way to access the flash chip(s) named **Hardware Sequencing**.
        It is much simpler than the normal access method (called **Software Sequencing**), but does not allow the software to
        choose the SPI commands to be sent. You can use the::

                flashrom -p internal:ich_spi_mode=value

        syntax where ``value`` can be ``auto``, ``swseq`` or ``hwseq``. By default (or when setting ``ich_spi_mode=auto``) the
        module tries to use swseq and only activates hwseq if need be (e.g. if important opcodes are inaccessible due to lockdown;
        or if more than one flash chip is attached). The other options (swseq, hwseq) select the respective mode (if possible).

        ICH8 and later southbridges may also have locked address ranges of different kinds if a valid descriptor was written to it.
        The flash address space is then partitioned in multiple so called "Flash Regions" containing the host firmware,
        the ME firmware and so on respectively. The flash descriptor can also specify up to 5 so called **Protected Regions**,
        which are freely chosen address ranges independent from the aforementioned **Flash Regions**.
        All of them can be write and/or read protected individually.

        If you have an Intel chipset with an ICH2 or later southbridge and if you want to set specific IDSEL values for a
        non-default flash chip or an embedded controller (EC), you can use the::

                flashrom -p internal:fwh_idsel=value

        syntax where ``value`` is the 48-bit hexadecimal raw value to be written in the IDSEL registers of the Intel southbridge.
        The upper 32 bits use one hex digit each per 512 kB range between 0xffc00000 and 0xffffffff, and the lower 16 bits
        use one hex digit each per 1024 kB range between 0xff400000 and 0xff7fffff.
        The rightmost hex digit corresponds with the lowest address range. All address ranges have a corresponding sister range
        4 MB below with identical IDSEL settings. The default value for ICH7 is given in the example below.

        Example::

                flashrom -p internal:fwh_idsel=0x001122334567


**Laptops**
        Using **flashrom** on older laptops that don't boot from the SPI bus is dangerous and may easily make your hardware unusable
        (see also the **BUGS** section). The embedded controller (EC) in some machines may interact badly with flashing.
        More information is at :doc:`/contrib_howtos/laptops_and_ec`.
        Problems occur when the flash chip is shared between BIOS and EC firmware, and the latter does not expect **flashrom**
        to access the chip. While **flashrom** tries to change the contents of that memory the EC might need to fetch new
        instructions or data from it and could stop working correctly. Probing for and reading from the chip may also irritate
        your EC and cause fan failure, backlight failure, sudden poweroff, and other nasty effects. **flashrom** will attempt to
        detect if it is running on such a laptop and limit probing to SPI buses. If you want to probe the LPC bus anyway at your own risk, use::

                flashrom -p internal:laptop=force_I_want_a_brick

        We will not help you if you force flashing on a laptop because this is a really dumb idea.

        You have been warned.

        Currently we rely on the chassis type encoded in the DMI/SMBIOS data to detect laptops. Some vendors did not implement
        those bits correctly or set them to generic and/or dummy values. **flashrom** will then issue a warning and restrict buses like above.
        In this case you can use::

                flashrom -p internal:laptop=this_is_not_a_laptop

        to tell **flashrom** (at your own risk) that it is not running on a laptop.


dummy programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The dummy programmer operates on a buffer in memory only. It provides a safe and fast way to test various aspects of
**flashrom** and is mainly used in development and while debugging.
It is able to emulate some chips to a certain degree (basic identify/read/erase/write operations work).

An optional parameter specifies the bus types it should support. For that you have to use the::

        flashrom -p dummy:bus=[type[+type[+type]]]

syntax where ``type`` can be ``parallel``, ``lpc``, ``fwh``, ``spi`` in any order. If you specify bus without type,
all buses will be disabled. If you do not specify bus, all buses will be enabled.

Example::

        flashrom -p dummy:bus=lpc+fwh

The dummy programmer supports flash chip emulation for automated self-tests without hardware access.
If you want to emulate a flash chip, use the::

        flashrom -p dummy:emulate=chip

syntax where ``chip`` is one of the following chips (please specify only the chip name, not the vendor):

* ST           ``M25P10.RES``      SPI flash chip (128 kB, RES, page write)
* SST          ``SST25VF040.REMS`` SPI flash chip (512 kB, REMS, byte write)
* SST          ``SST25VF032B``     SPI flash chip (4096 kB, RDID, AAI write)
* Macronix     ``MX25L6436``       SPI flash chip (8192 kB, RDID, SFDP)
* Winbond      ``W25Q128FV``       SPI flash chip (16384 kB, RDID)
* Spansion     ``S25FL128L``       SPI flash chip (16384 kB, RDID)
* Dummy vendor ``VARIABLE_SIZE``   SPI flash chip (configurable size, page write)

Example::

        flashrom -p dummy:emulate=SST25VF040.REMS

To use ``VARIABLE_SIZE`` chip, ``size`` must be specified to configure the size of the flash chip as a power of two.

Example::

        flashrom -p dummy:emulate=VARIABLE_SIZE,size=16777216,image=dummy.bin


**Persistent images**
        If you use flash chip emulation, flash image persistence is available as well by using the::

                flashrom -p dummy:emulate=chip,image=image.rom

        syntax where ``image.rom`` is the file where the simulated chip contents are read on **flashrom** startup and where the
        chip contents on **flashrom** shutdown are written to.

        Example::

                flashrom -p dummy:emulate=M25P10.RES,image=dummy.bin


**SPI write chunk size**
        If you use SPI flash chip emulation for a chip which supports SPI page write with the default opcode,
        you can set the maximum allowed write chunk size with the::

                flashrom -p dummy:emulate=chip,spi_write_256_chunksize=size

        syntax where ``size`` is the number of bytes (min.\& 1, max.\& 256).
        Example::

                flashrom -p dummy:emulate=M25P10.RES,spi_write_256_chunksize=5


**SPI blacklist**
        To simulate a programmer which refuses to send certain SPI commands to the flash chip, you can specify a blacklist of
        SPI commands with the::

                flashrom -p dummy:spi_blacklist=commandlist

        syntax where ``ommandlist`` is a list of two-digit hexadecimal representations of SPI commands.
        If commandlist is e.g. 0302, **flashrom** will behave as if the SPI controller refuses to run command 0x03 (READ) and command 0x02 (WRITE).
        commandlist may be up to 512 characters (256 commands) long.
        Implementation note: **flashrom** will detect an error during command execution.


**SPI ignorelist**
        To simulate a flash chip which ignores (doesn't support) certain SPI commands, you can specify an ignorelist of SPI commands with the::

                flashrom -p dummy:spi_ignorelist=commandlist

        syntax where ``commandlist`` is a list of two-digit hexadecimal representations of SPI commands.
        If commandlist is e.g. 0302, the emulated flash chip will ignore command 0x03 (READ) and command 0x02 (WRITE).
        ``commandlist`` may be up to 512 characters (256 commands) long.
        Implementation note: **flashrom** won't detect an error during command execution.


**SPI status register**
        You can specify the initial content of the chip's status register with the::

                flashrom -p dummy:spi_status=content"

        syntax where ``content`` is a hexadecimal value of up to 24 bits. For example, ``0x332211`` assigns 0x11 to SR1,
        0x22 to SR2 and 0x33 to SR3. Shorter value is padded to 24 bits with zeroes on the left.
        See datasheet for chosen chip for details about the registers content.


**Write protection**
        Chips with emulated WP: **W25Q128FV**, **S25FL128L**.

        You can simulate state of hardware protection pin (WP) with the::

                flashrom -p dummy:hwwp=state

        syntax where ``state`` is ``yes`` or ``no`` (default value). ``yes`` means active state of the pin implies that chip is
        write-protected (on real hardware the pin is usually negated, but not here).

**Frequency**
        Frequency can be specified in ``Hz`` (default), ``KHz``, or ``MHz`` (not case sensitive).
        If ``freq`` parameter is passed in from command line, commands will delay for certain time before returning,
        so that to emulate the requested frequency.

        Valid range is [1Hz, 8000Mhz] and there is no delay by default.

        The delay of an SPI command is proportional to the number of bits send over SPI bus in both directions
        and is calculated based on the assumption that we transfer at 1 bit/Hz::

                flashrom -p dummy:emulate=W25Q128FV,freq=64mhz


nic3com, nicrealtek, nicnatsemi, nicintel, nicintel_eeprom, nicintel_spi, gfxnvidia, ogp_spi, drkaiser, satasii, satamv, atahpt, atavia, atapromise, it8212 programmers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These programmers have an option to specify the PCI address of the card your want to use, which must be specified if
more than one card supported by the selected programmer is installed in your system. The syntax is::

        flashrom -p xxxx:pci=bb:dd.f

where ``xxxx`` is the name of the programmer, ``bb`` is the PCI bus number, ``dd`` is the PCI device number, and ``b``
is the PCI function number of the desired device. Example::

        flashrom -p nic3com:pci=05:04.0

Some of these programmers have more info below.

atavia programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The VT6421A is a PATA/SATA PCI controller that can be found on various cheap PCI cards.
Currently there is a `datasheet <http://spacehopper.org/mirrors/ftp.vtbridge.org/Docs/Storage/DS_VT6421A_100_CCPL.PDF>`_.

There exists a patch for flashrom that makes it possible to access the attached flash chip,
but it has problems with some cards. They seem to need an offset added to the chip address for unknown reasons.

Due to the mysterious address handling of the VIA VT6421A controller the user can specify an offset with the::

        flashrom -p atavia:offset=addr

syntax where ``addr`` will be interpreted as usual (leading 0x (0) for hexadecimal (octal) values, or else decimal).

atapromise programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This programmer is currently limited to 32 kB, regardless of the actual size of the flash chip. This stems from the
fact that, on the tested device (a Promise Ultra100), not all of the chip's address lines were actually connected.
You may use this programmer to flash firmware updates, since these are only 16 kB in size (padding to 32 kB is required).

nic3com programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

flashrom supports some 3Com network cards to reflash the (parallel) flash attached to these cards,
but it is also possible to use these cards to reflash other chips which fit in there electrically.
Please note that the small number of address lines connected to the chip may make accessing large chips impossible.
The maximum supported chip size is 128KB.

nicintel_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Programmer for SPI flash ROMs on Intel Gigabit network cards. Tested on 32-bit hardware/PCI only.

nicintel_eeprom programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the first programmer module in **flashrom** that does not provide access to NOR flash chips but EEPROMs mounted on
gigabit Ethernet cards based on Intel's 82580 NIC. Because EEPROMs normally do not announce their size nor allow
themselves to be identified, the controller relies on correct size values written to predefined addresses within the chip.
**Flashrom** follows this scheme but assumes the minimum size of 16 kB (128 kb) if an unprogrammed EEPROM/card is detected.
Intel specifies following EEPROMs to be compatible:
Atmel AT25128, AT25256, Micron (ST) M95128, M95256 and OnSemi (Catalyst) CAT25CS128.

gfxnvidia programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Flashrom supports some Nvidia graphic cards to reflash the (parallel) flash attached to these cards,
but it is also possible to use these cards to reflash other chips which fit in there electrically.

satasii programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Flashrom supports some SiI ATA/SATA controllers to reflash the flash attached to these controller cards,
but it is also possible to use these cards to reflash other chips which fit in there electrically.
Please note that the small number of address lines connected to the chip may make accessing large chips impossible.

ft2232_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module supports various programmers based on FTDI FT2232/FT4232H/FT232H chips including the DLP Design DLP-USB1232H,
openbiosprog-spi, Amontec JTAGkey/JTAGkey-tiny/JTAGkey-2, Dangerous Prototypes Bus Blaster, Digilent JTAG-SMT2/-NC,
Olimex ARM-USB-TINY/-H, Olimex ARM-USB-OCD/-H, OpenMoko Neo1973 Debug board (V2+), TIAO/DIYGADGET USB Multi-Protocol
Adapter (TUMPA), TUMPA Lite, GOEPEL PicoTAP, Google Servo v1/v2, Tin Can Tools Flyswatter/Flyswatter 2 and Kristech KT-LINK.

An optional parameter specifies the controller type, channel/interface/port it should support. For that you have to use the::

        flashrom \-p ft2232_spi:type=model,port=interface

syntax where ``model`` can be ``2232H``, ``4232H``, ``232H``, ``jtagkey``, ``busblaster``, ``openmoko``, ``arm-usb-tiny``,
``arm-usb-tiny-h``, ``arm-usb-ocd``, ``arm-usb-ocd-h``, ``tumpa``, ``tumpalite``, ``picotap``, ``google-servo,
``google-servo-v2``, ``google-servo-v2-legacy`` or ``kt-link``.
``interface`` can be ``A``, ``B``, ``C``, or ``D``. The default model is ``4232H``, the default interface is ``A`` and
GPIO is not used by default.

If there is more than one ft2232_spi-compatible device connected, you can select which one should be used by specifying
its serial number with the::

        flashrom -p ft2232_spi:serial=number

syntax where ``number`` is the serial number of the device (which can be found for example in the output of lsusb -v).

All models supported by the **ft2232_spi** driver can configure the SPI clock rate by setting a divisor. The expressible
divisors are all **even** numbers between 2 and 2^17 (=131072) resulting in SPI clock frequencies of 6 MHz down to about
92 Hz for 12 MHz inputs (non-H chips) and 30 MHz down to about 458 Hz for 60 MHz inputs ('H' chips). The default divisor
is set to 2, but you can use another one by specifying the optional ``divisor`` parameter with the::

        flashrom -p ft2232_spi:divisor=div

syntax. Using the parameter ``csgpiol`` (DEPRECATED - use ``gpiol`` instead) an additional CS# pin can be chosen,
where the value can be a number between 0 and 3, denoting GPIOL0-GPIOL3 correspondingly. Example::

        flashrom -p ft2232_spi:csgpiol=3

The parameter ``gpiolX=[HLC]`` allows use of the GPIOL pins either as generic gpios with a fixed value during flashing
or as additional CS# signal, where ``X`` can be a number between 0 and 3, denoting GPIOL0-GPIOL3 correspondingly.
The parameter may be specified multiple times, one time per GPIOL pin. Valid values are ``H``, ``L`` and ``C``:

* ``H`` - Set GPIOL output high
* ``L`` - Set GPIOL output low
* ``C`` - Use GPIOL as additional CS# output

Example::

        flashrom -p ft2232_spi:gpiol0=H

**Note** that not all GPIOL pins are freely usable with all programmers as some have special functionality.


serprog programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module supports all programmers speaking the serprog protocol. This includes some Arduino-based devices as well as
various programmers by Urja Rannikko, Juhana Helovuo, Stefan Tauner, Chi Zhang and many others.

A mandatory parameter specifies either a serial device (and baud rate) or an IP/port combination for communicating with
the programmer. The device/baud combination has to start with ``dev=`` and separate the optional baud rate with a colon.
For example::

        flashrom -p serprog:dev=/dev/ttyS0:115200

If no baud rate is given the default values by the operating system/hardware will be used.
For IP connections you have to use the::

        flashrom -p serprog:ip=ipaddr:port

syntax. In case the device supports it, you can set the SPI clock frequency with the optional ``spispeed`` parameter.
The frequency is parsed as hertz, unless an ``M``, or ``k`` suffix is given, then megahertz or kilohertz are used respectively.
Example that sets the frequency to 2 MHz::

        flashrom -p serprog:dev=/dev/device:baud,spispeed=2M

Optional ``cs`` parameter can be used to switch which chip select number is used. This allows connecting multiple
chips at once and selecting which one to flash by software means (rather than rewiring)::

        flashrom -p serprog:dev=/dev/device:baud,cs=0

The particular programmer implementation needs to support this feature, for it to work. If the requested chip
select isn't available, flashrom will fail safely.

More information about serprog is available in this document: :doc:`/supported_hw/supported_prog/serprog/serprog-protocol`.


buspirate_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A required ``dev`` parameter specifies the Bus Pirate device node and an optional ``spispeed`` parameter specifies the
frequency of the SPI bus. The parameter delimiter is a comma. Syntax is::

        flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/device,spispeed=frequency

where ``frequency`` can be ``30k``, ``125k``, ``250k``, ``1M``, ``2M``, ``2.6M``, ``4M`` or ``8M`` (in Hz).
The default is the maximum frequency of 8 MHz.

The baud rate for communication between the host and the Bus Pirate can be specified with the optional ``serialspeed``
parameter. Syntax is::

        flashrom -p buspirate_spi:serialspeed=baud

where ``baud`` can be ``115200``, ``230400``, ``250000`` or ``2000000`` (``2M``).
The default is ``2M`` baud for Bus Pirate hardware version 3.0 and greater, and 115200 otherwise.

An optional pullups parameter specifies the use of the Bus Pirate internal pull-up resistors. This may be needed if you
are working with a flash ROM chip that you have physically removed from the board. Syntax is::

        flashrom -p buspirate_spi:pullups=state

where ``state`` can be ``on`` or ``off``.
More information about the Bus Pirate pull-up resistors and their purpose is available
`in a guide by dangerousprototypes <http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Practical_guide_to_Bus_Pirate_pull-up_resistors>`_.

When working with low-voltage chips, the internal 10k pull-ups of the Bus Pirate might be too high. In such cases, it's necessary to create an external pull-up using lower-value resistors.

For this, you can use the ``hiz`` parameter. This way, the Bus Pirate will operate as an open drain. Syntax is::

        flashrom -p buspirate_spi:hiz=state

where ``state`` can be ``on`` or ``off``.

The state of the Bus Pirate power supply pins is controllable through an optional ``psus`` parameter. Syntax is::

        flashrom -p buspirate_spi:psus=state

where ``state`` can be ``on`` or ``off``.
This allows the bus pirate to power the ROM chip directly. This may also be used to provide the required pullup voltage
(when using the **pullups** option), by connecting the Bus Pirate's Vpu input to the appropriate Vcc pin.

An optional aux parameter specifies the state of the Bus Pirate auxiliary pin.
This may be used to drive the auxiliary pin high or low before a transfer.
Syntax is::

        flashrom -p buspirate_spi:aux=state

where ``state`` can be ``high`` or ``low``. The default ``state`` is ``high``.


pickit2_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An optional ``voltage`` parameter specifies the voltage the PICkit2 should use. The default unit is Volt if no unit is specified.
You can use ``mV``, ``millivolt``, ``V`` or ``Volt`` as unit specifier. Syntax is::

        flashrom \-p pickit2_spi:voltage=value

where ``value`` can be ``0V``, ``1.8V``, ``2.5V``, ``3.5V`` or the equivalent in mV.

An optional ``spispeed`` parameter specifies the frequency of the SPI bus. Syntax is::

        flashrom -p pickit2_spi:spispeed=frequency

where ``frequency`` can be ``250k``, ``333k``, ``500k`` or ``1M`` (in Hz). The default is a frequency of 1 MHz.


dediprog programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An optional ``voltage`` parameter specifies the voltage the Dediprog should use. The default unit is Volt if no unit is specified.
You can use ``mV``, ``milliVolt``, ``V`` or ``Volt`` as unit specifier. Syntax is::

        flashrom -p dediprog:voltage=value

where ``value`` can be ``0V``, ``1.8V``, ``2.5V``, ``3.5V`` or the equivalent in mV.

An optional ``device`` parameter specifies which of multiple connected Dediprog devices should be used.
Please be aware that the order depends on libusb's usb_get_busses() function and that the numbering starts at 0.
Usage example to select the second device::

        flashrom -p dediprog:device=1

An optional ``spispeed`` parameter specifies the frequency of the SPI bus. The firmware on the device needs to be 5.0.0 or newer.
Syntax is::

        flashrom -p dediprog:spispeed=frequency

where ``frequency`` can be ``375k``, ``750k``, ``1.5M``, ``2.18M``, ``3M``, ``8M``, ``12M`` or ``24M`` (in Hz).
The default is a frequency of 12 MHz.

An optional ``target`` parameter specifies which target chip should be used. Syntax is::

        flashrom -p dediprog:target=value

where ``value`` can be ``1`` or ``2`` to select target chip 1 or 2 respectively. The default is target chip 1.


rayer_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default I/O base address used for the parallel port is 0x378 and you can use the optional ``iobase`` parameter to
specify an alternate base I/O address with the::

        flashrom -p rayer_spi:iobase=baseaddr

syntax where ``baseaddr`` is base I/O port address of the parallel port, which must be a multiple of four.
Make sure to not forget the "0x" prefix for hexadecimal port addresses.

The default cable type is the RayeR cable. You can use the optional ``type`` parameter to specify the cable type with the::

        flashrom -p rayer_spi:type=model

syntax where ``model`` can be ``rayer`` for the RayeR cable, ``byteblastermv`` for the Altera ByteBlasterMV,
``stk200`` for the Atmel, ``STK200/300``, ``wiggler`` for the Macraigor Wiggler, ``xilinx`` for the Xilinx Parallel Cable III (DLC 5),
or ``spi_tt`` for SPI Tiny Tools-compatible hardware.

More information about the RayeR hardware is available at `RayeR's website <http://rayer.g6.cz/elektro/spipgm.htm>`_.
The Altera ByteBlasterMV datasheet can be obtained from `Altera <http://www.altera.co.jp/literature/ds/dsbytemv.pdf>`_.
For more information about the Macraigor Wiggler see `their company homepage <http://www.macraigor.com/wiggler.htm>`_.
The schematic of the Xilinx DLC 5 was published in `a Xilinx guide <http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/xtp029.pdf>`_.


raiden_debug_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some devices such as the GSC knows how it is wired to AP and EC flash chips, and can be told which specific device to talk to using the ``target`` parameter::

        flashrom -p raiden_debug_spi:target={ap,ec}

Other devices such as Servo Micro and HyperDebug are generic, and do not know how they are wired, the caller is responsible for first configure the appropriate MUXes or buffers, and then tell the debugger which port to use (Servo Micro has just one SPI port, HyperDebug is the first of this kind to have multiple)::

        flashrom -p raiden_debug_spi:target=N

where ``N`` is an non-negative integer (default ``0``).

The default is to use the first available servo. You can use the optional ``serial`` parameter to specify the servo
USB device serial number to use specifically with::

        flashrom -p raiden_debug_spi:serial=XXX

The servo device serial number can be found via ``lsusb``.
Raiden will poll the ``ap`` target waiting for the system power to settle on the AP and EC flash devices.

The optional ``custom_rst=true`` parameter alters the behavior of the reset process::

        flashrom -p raiden_debug_spi:custom_rst=<true|false>

syntax, where:

``custom_rst=false`` is the implicit default timeout of 3ms

and ``custom_rst=true`` set ``RAIDEN_DEBUG_SPI_REQ_ENABLE_AP_CUSTOM`` instead of ``RAIDEN_DEBUG_SPI_REQ_ENABLE_AP``.
This custom reset will modify the timeout from 3ms to 10ms and will not set ``EC_RST_L``, meaning neither the EC nor the AP will be reset. With this setting, it's the user's responsibility to manage the reset signal manually or by configuring the GPIO.
Failure to handle the reset signal appropriately will likely result in flashing errors.

More information about the ChromiumOS servo
hardware is available at `servos website <https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/hdctools/+/HEAD/docs/servo_v4.md>`_.


pony_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The serial port (like /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux or COM3 on windows) is specified using the mandatory ``dev``
parameter. The adapter type is selectable between SI-Prog (used for SPI devices with PonyProg 2000) or a custom made
serial bitbanging programmer named "serbang". The optional ``type`` parameter accepts the values ``si_prog`` (default)
or ``serbang``.

Information about the SI-Prog adapter can be found at `its website <http://www.lancos.com/siprogsch.html>`_.

An example call to **flashrom** is::

        flashrom -p pony_spi:dev=/dev/ttyS0,type=serbang

Please note that while USB-to-serial adapters work under certain circumstances, this slows down operation considerably.


ogp_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The flash ROM chip to access must be specified with the ``rom`` parameter::

        flashrom -p ogp_spi:rom=name

Where ``name`` is either ``cprom`` or ``s3`` for the configuration ROM and ``bprom`` or ``bios`` for the BIOS ROM.
If more than one card supported by the **ogp_spi** programmer is installed in your system, you have to specify the PCI
address of the card you want to use with the ``pci=`` parameter as explained in the **nic3com** et al. section above.


linux_mtd programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may specify the MTD device to use with the::

        flashrom -p linux_mtd:dev=/dev/mtdX

syntax where ``/dev/mtdX`` is the Linux device node for your MTD device. If left unspecified the first MTD device found
(e.g. /dev/mtd0) will be used by default.

Please note that the linux_mtd driver only works on Linux.


linux_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have to specify the SPI controller to use with the::

        flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidevX.Y

syntax where ``/dev/spidevX.Y`` is the Linux device node for your SPI controller.

In case the device supports it, you can set the SPI clock frequency with the optional ``spispeed`` parameter.
The frequency is parsed as kilohertz. Example that sets the frequency to 8 MHz::

        flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidevX.Y,spispeed=8000

Please note that the linux_spi driver only works on Linux.


mstarddc_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Display Data Channel (DDC) is an I2C bus present on VGA and DVI connectors, that allows exchanging information
between a computer and attached displays. Its most common uses are getting display capabilities through EDID
(at I2C address 0x50) and sending commands to the display using the DDC/CI protocol (at address 0x37).
On displays driven by MSTAR SoCs, it is also possible to access the SoC firmware flash (connected to the Soc through another SPI bus)
using an In-System Programming (ISP) port, usually at address 0x49. This **flashrom** module allows the latter via Linux's I2C driver.

**IMPORTANT:**
Before using this programmer, the display **MUST** be in standby mode, and only connected to the computer that will run
**flashrom** using a VGA cable, to an inactive VGA output. It absolutely **MUST NOT** be used as a display during the procedure!

You have to specify the DDC/I2C controller and I2C address to use with the::

        flashrom -p mstarddc_spi:dev=/dev/i2c-X:YY

syntax where ``/dev/i2c-X`` is the Linux device node for your I2C controller connected to the display's DDC channel, and
``YY`` is the (hexadecimal) address of the MSTAR ISP port (address 0x49 is usually used).
Example that uses I2C controller /dev/i2c-1 and address 0x49::

        flashrom -p mstarddc_spi:dev=/dev/i2c-1:49

It is also possible to inhibit the reset command that is normally sent to the display once the **flashrom** operation is
completed using the optional ``noreset`` parameter. A value of 1 prevents **flashrom** from sending the reset command.
Example that does not reset the display at the end of the operation::

        flashrom -p mstarddc_spi:dev=/dev/i2c-1:49,noreset=1

Please note that sending the reset command is also inhibited if an error occurred during the operation.
To send the reset command afterwards, you can simply run **flashrom** once more, in chip probe mode (not specifying an operation),
without the ``noreset`` parameter, once the flash read/write operation you intended to perform has completed successfully.

Please also note that the mstarddc_spi driver only works on Linux.


ch341a_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The WCH CH341A programmer does not support any parameters currently. SPI frequency is fixed at 2 MHz, and CS0 is used
as per the device.


ch347_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An optional ``spispeed`` parameter could be used to specify the SPI speed. This parameter is available for the CH347T and CH347F device.
The default SPI speed is 15MHz if no value is specified.
Syntax is::

        flashrom -p ch347_spi:spispeed=value

where ``value`` can be ``60M``, ``30M``, ``15M``, ``7.5M``, ``3.75M``, ``1.875M``, ``937.5K``, ``468.75K``.


ni845x_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An optional ``voltage`` parameter could be used to specify the IO voltage. This parameter is available for the NI USB-8452 device.
The default unit is Volt if no unit is specified. You can use ``mV``, ``milliVolt``, ``V`` or ``Volt`` as unit specifier.
Syntax is::

        flashrom -p ni845x_spi:voltage=value

where ``value`` can be ``1.2V``, ``1.5V``, ``1.8V``, ``2.5V``, ``3.3V`` or the equivalent in mV.

In the case if none of the programmer's supported IO voltage is within the supported voltage range of the detected flash
chip the **flashrom** will abort the operation (to prevent damaging the flash chip).
You can override this behaviour by passing ``yes`` to the ``ignore_io_voltage_limits`` parameter
(for e.g. if you are using an external voltage translator circuit). Syntax is::

        flashrom -p ni845x_spi:ignore_io_voltage_limits=yes

You can use the ``serial`` parameter to explicitly specify which connected NI USB-845x device should be used. You should
use your device's 7 digit hexadecimal serial number. Usage example to select the device with 1230A12 serial number::

        flashrom -p ni845x_spi:serial=1230A12

An optional ``spispeed`` parameter specifies the frequency of the SPI bus. Syntax is::

        flashrom -p ni845x_spi:spispeed=frequency

where ``frequency`` should a number corresponding to the desired frequency in kHz.
The maximum ``frequency`` is 12 MHz (12000 kHz) for the USB-8451 and 50 MHz (50000 kHz) for the USB-8452.
The default is a frequency of 1 MHz (1000 kHz).

An optional ``cs`` parameter specifies which target chip select line should be used. Syntax is::

        flashrom -p ni845x_spi:csnumber=value

where ``value`` should be between ``0`` and ``7``. By default the CS0 is used.


digilent_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An optional ``spispeed`` parameter specifies the frequency of the SPI bus. Syntax is::

        flashrom -p digilent_spi:spispeed=frequency

where ``frequency`` can be ``62.5k``, ``125k``, ``250k``, ``500k``, ``1M``, ``2M`` or ``4M`` (in Hz).
The default is a frequency of 4 MHz.


dirtyjtag_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An optional ``freq`` parameter specifies the frequency of the SPI bus. Syntax is::

        flashrom -p dirtyjtag_spi:spispeed=frequency

where ``spispeed`` can be any value in hertz, kilohertz or megahertz supported by the programmer.
The default is a frequency of 100 KHz.


jlink_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module supports SEGGER J-Link and compatible devices.

The **MOSI** signal of the flash chip must be attached to **TDI** pin of the programmer, **MISO** to **TDO** and
**SCK** to **TCK**. The chip select (**CS**) signal of the flash chip can be attached to different pins of the
programmer which can be selected with the::

        flashrom -p jlink_spi:cs=pin

syntax where ``pin`` can be either ``TRST``, ``RESET`` or ``TMS``. The default pin for chip select is ``RESET``.
Note that, when using ``RESET``, it is normal that the indicator LED blinks orange or red.

Additionally, the ``Tref`` pin of the programmer must be attached to the logic level of the flash chip.
The programmer measures the voltage on this pin and generates the reference
voltage for its input comparators and adapts its output voltages to it.

Pinout for devices with 20-pin JTAG connector::

          +-------+
          |  1  2 |     1: VTref     2:
          |  3  4 |     3: TRST      4: GND
          |  5  6 |     5: TDI       6: GND
        +-+  7  8 |     7: TMS       8: GND
        |    9 10 |     9: TCK      10: GND
        |   11 12 |    11:          12: GND
        +-+ 13 14 |    13: TDO      14:
          | 15 16 |    15: RESET    16:
          | 17 18 |    17:          18:
          | 19 20 |    19: PWR_5V   20:
          +-------+

If there is more than one compatible device connected, you can select which one should be used by specifying its serial
number with the::

        flashrom -p jlink_spi:serial=number

syntax where ``number`` is the serial number of the device (which can be found for example in the output of ``lsusb -v``).

The SPI speed can be selected by using the::

        flashrom -p jlink_spi:spispeed=frequency

syntax where ``frequency`` is the SPI clock frequency in kHz. The maximum speed depends on the device in use.

The ``power=on`` option can be used to activate the 5 V power supply (PWR_5V) of the J-Link during a flash operation.


stlinkv3_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module supports SPI flash programming through the STMicroelectronics STLINK V3 programmer/debugger's SPI bridge interface::

        flashrom -p stlinkv3_spi

If there is more than one compatible device connected, you can select which one should be used by specifying its
serial number with the::

        flashrom -p stlinkv3_spi:serial=number

syntax where ``number`` is the serial number of the device (which can be found for example in the output of ``lsusb -v``).

The SPI speed can be selected by using the::

        flashrom -p stlinkv3_spi:spispeed=frequency

syntax where ``frequency`` is the SPI clock frequency in kHz. If the passed frequency is not supported by the adapter
the nearest lower supported frequency will be used.


realtek_mst_i2c_spi, parade_lspcon and mediatek_i2c_spi programmers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These programmers tunnel SPI commands through I2C-connected devices. The I2C bus over which communication occurs must be
specified either by device path with the ``devpath`` option::

        flashrom -p realtek_mst_i2c_spi:devpath=/dev/i2c-8

or by a bus number with the ``bus`` option, which implies a device path like ``/dev/i2c-N`` where ``N`` is the specified
bus number::

        flashrom -p parade_lspcon:bus=8


realtek_mst_i2c_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This programmer supports SPI flash programming for chips attached to Realtek DisplayPort MST hubs, themselves accessed
through I2C (tunneling SPI flash commands through the MST hub's I2C connection with the host).


In-system programming (ISP) mode
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``reset_mcu`` and ``enter_isp`` options provide control over device mode changes, where each can be set to ``0``
or ``1`` to enable or disable the corresponding mode transition.

``enter_isp`` defaults to ``1``, and if enabled will issue commands to the MST hub when beginning operation to put it
into ISP mode.

``reset_mcu`` defaults to ``0``, and if enabled will issue a reset command to the MST hub on programming completion,
causing it to exit ISP mode and to reload its own firmware from flash.

``allow_brick`` defaults to ``no``, however must be set explicitly to ``yes`` to allow the driver to run if you are sure
you have a MST chip.

The hub must be in ISP mode for SPI flash access to be possible, so it is usually only useful to disable ``enter_isp``
if an earlier invocation avoided resetting it on completion. For instance, to erase the flash and rewrite it with the
contents of a file without resetting in between (which could render it nonfunctional if attempting to load firmware
from a blank flash)::

        flashrom -p realtek_mst_i2c_spi:bus=0,enter_isp=1,reset_mcu=0 -E

        flashrom -p realtek_mst_i2c_spi:bus=0,enter_isp=0,reset_mcu=1 -w new.bin


parade_lspcon programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This programmer supports SPI flash programming for chips attached to Parade Technologies DisplayPort-to-HDMI level
shifter/protocol converters (LSPCONs), e.g. the PS175. Communication to the SPI flash is tunneled through the LSPCON
over I2C.


mediatek_i2c_spi programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This programmer supports SPI flash programming for chips attached to some Mediatek display controllers, themselves
accessed through I2C (tunneling SPI flash commands through an I2C connection with the host).

The programmer is designed to support the TSUMOP82JUQ integrated display driver and scaler as used in the Google Meet
Series One Desk 27 (which runs a version of ChromeOS and uses **flashrom** in its ``tsum-scaler-updater`` scripts that ship
with the OS). Other chips may use compatible protocols but have not been tested with this programmer, and external chip
IOs may need to be controlled through other non- **flashrom** means to configure the chip in order for it to operate as expected.

``devpath`` and ``bus`` options select the I2C bus to use, as described previously. ``allow_brick`` defaults to ``no``,
and must explicitly be set to ``yes`` in order for the programmer to operate. This is required because there is no
mechanism in the driver to positively identify that a given I2C bus is actually connected to a supported device.


spidriver programmer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a SPI hardware interface with a display (https://spidriver.com/),
connected as an FT230X USB serial device at a fixed baud rate of 460800.

Firmware: https://github.com/jamesbowman/spidriver

A required ``dev`` parameter specifies the Excamera Labs SPIDriver device node
and an optional ``mode`` parameter specifies the mode of the SPI bus. The
parameter delimiter is a comma. Syntax is::

        flashrom -p spidriver:dev=/dev/device,mode=0

where ``mode`` can be ``0``, ``1``, ``2`` or ``3``. The default is mode 0.
Setting the SPI mode requires version 2 of the device firmware.

An optional A and/or B parameter specifies the state of the SPIDriver A and B pins.
This may be used to drive the A or B pins high or low before a transfer.
Syntax is::

        flashrom -p spidriver:a=state,b=state

where ``state`` can be ``high`` or ``low``. The default ``state`` is ``high``.


EXAMPLES
--------

To back up and update your BIOS, run::

        flashrom -p internal -r backup.rom -o backuplog.txt
        flashrom -p internal -w newbios.rom -o writelog.txt

Please make sure to copy backup.rom to some external media before you try to write. That makes offline recovery easier.

If writing fails and **flashrom** complains about the chip being in an unknown state, you can try to restore the backup by running::

        flashrom -p internal -w backup.rom -o restorelog.txt

If you encounter any problems, please contact us and supply backuplog.txt, writelog.txt and restorelog.txt.
See section **BUGS** for contact info.

Laptops
-------

Using **flashrom** on older laptops is dangerous and may easily make your hardware unusable. **flashrom** will attempt to detect
if it is running on a susceptible laptop and restrict flash-chip probing for safety reasons. Please see the detailed
discussion of this topic and associated **flashrom** options in the **Laptops** paragraph in the **internal programmer**
subsection of the **PROGRAMMER-SPECIFIC INFORMATION** section and the information at :doc:`/contrib_howtos/laptops_and_ec`.

One-time programmable (OTP) memory and unique IDs

Some flash chips contain OTP memory often denoted as **security registers**. They usually have a capacity in the range
of some bytes to a few hundred bytes and can be used to give devices unique IDs etc. **flashrom** is not able to read
or write these memories and may therefore not be able to duplicate a chip completely. For chip types known to include
OTP memories a warning is printed when they are detected.

Similar to OTP memories are unique, factory programmed, unforgeable IDs. They are not modifiable by the user at all.
