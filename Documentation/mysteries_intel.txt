= BBAR on ICH8 =
 There is no sign of BBAR (BIOS Base Address Configuration Register) in the
 public datasheet (or specification update) of the ICH8. Also, the offset of
 that register has changed between ICH7 (SPIBAR + 50h) and ICH9 (SPIBAR +
 A0h), so we have no clue if or where it is on ICH8. Out current policy is to
 not touch it at all and assume/hope it is 0.

= Accesses beyond region bounds in descriptor mode =
 Intel's flash image tool will always expand the last region so that it covers
 the whole flash chip, but some boards ship with a different configuration.
 It seems that in descriptor mode all addresses outside the used regions can not
 be accessed whatsoever. This is not specified anywhere publicly as far as we
 could tell. flashrom does not handle this explicitly yet. It will just fail
 when trying to touch an address outside of any region.
